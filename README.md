I completed this project during the precourse work for [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). All the work is my own.

It began as an exercise to learn basic HTML, CSS, and jQuery operations. It became an exciting learning opportunity to practice Backbone. After completing the CodeSchool courses on Backbone, I refactored this project to use that framework. (You can see this in the commit history.)

I then expanded the project to practice using AJAX and Parse.
